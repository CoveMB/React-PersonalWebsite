      Building a small DEFI and DAO DAPP to teach blockchain :

    <br />I started to grow an interest in{" "}
    <strong className="blueTitle">blockchain technology</strong> and how it
    could change the web and impact some of our social processes. My family and
    friends also got curious about blockchain the more I talked about it. I
    started <strong className="blueTitle">teaching sessions</strong> where I
    explain blockchain fundamentals, getting into technological and practical
    concepts. There is nothing better than practice to retain learning
    information so I built a small{" "}
    <strong className="blueTitle">DEFI and DAO DAPP</strong> so that the persons
    I am teaching to can interact with{" "}
    <strong className="blueTitle">Ethereumâ€™s testnet</strong>. I created an{" "}
    <strong className="blueTitle">ERC20 token named Astro Light</strong> that
    people can buy and then either <strong className="blueTitle">swap</strong>{" "}
    for another token or <strong className="blueTitle">stake</strong>. As ASTRO
    holders they can also participate in the{" "}

    <br /> I joined Aldo just before the start of a big project that was to

    It was not an easy task since this system is interconnected with multiple
    other systems and OMS is the glue that connects them all.

    The new OMS was built with the latest concepts and technologies with an{" "}

    With Tooly we enrolled in

    <strong className="blueTitle"> Javascript and Python </strong>
    on my own, now it was time to practice my coding skills with a team.
    <br />
    The Wagon offered me the opportunity to do just that. My project was
    selected as a final project. We built an app that would bring people
    together depending on their cultural interest. The app included a built-in

    <br /> Working as a digital marketing specialist, I had a lot of reporting

    reporting easier, I Learned
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Python </strong>
    and used Apache Airflow to build a data pipeline
    <br />
    The first part of the pipeline connects to different APIs (Google
    Ads/Facebook/Google Analytics/CRM) to get the data I need for my reporting.
    The data is then sent to a<strong className="blueTitle"> Big Query </strong>
    data warehouse. The second part of the pipeline uses
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Pandas </strong>
    to process the data from different sources to get some useful insights. The
    result is sent by email.

    To make the development of this app easier I used
