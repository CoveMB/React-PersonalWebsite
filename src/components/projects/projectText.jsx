    During Centech's acceleration program I met with Olivier his goal was to be able to recommend you the best SaaS for your needs, and offered me to hop in the project.
    <br />
    With Tooly we enrolled in
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Next AI's </strong>
    incubation program. I, of course, had to build the tech side of the project from
    <strong className="blueTitle"> machine learning models </strong>
    to an admin panel with
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Koa and Graphql</strong>
    .
    <br />
    But I also had the opportunity to participate in the development of the whole product from business model to MVP experiments.

    Alongside Tooly, there is another business Cominity, the agency.
    <br />
    Being part of an agency has led me to learn a handful of technologies. I was able to engineer the whole CI/CD pipeline for the applications
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Dockerizing </strong>
    the app on the way. I learned
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Kubernetes </strong>
    and
    <strong className="blueTitle"> serverless </strong>
    tools like
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Lambda </strong>
    to figure out the best solutions for our needs.

    At the end of Le Wagon bootcamp, one of the students came to me: his idea has been accepted to the Centech's Acceleration program and he proposed me to be the CTO for the project.
    <br />
    Following the training offered by the Centech made me enter the
    <strong className="blueTitle"> entrepreneur's </strong>
    world which I have found too thrilling to quit since.
    <br />
    The project was a data visualisation tool for physical rehabilitation professionals. I use this opportunity to learn some new technology like
    <strong className="blueTitle"> React </strong>
    to quickly build our first MVP.

    After graduating from the Wagon they asked me to join their forces and become a teacher assistant, soon enough I became a teacher.
    <br />
    I always liked explaining things to others and finding ways they could understand the same with their own logic. Becoming a teacher for the
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Javascript </strong>
    part of the program allowed me to share my passion for the language. Even if I had great confidence in my technology's skill I had to overcome my fear of speaking in front of an audience..

    After having successfully built a data pipeline to automate my reporting, I realised that I was having more fun developing and coding than building marketing campaigns. I already Learned
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Javascript and Python </strong>
    on my own, now it was time to practice my coding skills with a team.
    <br />
    The Wagon offered me the opportunity to do just that. My project was selected as a final project. We built an app that would bring people together depending on their cultural interest. The app included a built-in instant messaging service using
    <strong className="blueTitle"> WebSockets</strong>
    .

    <strong className="blueTitle">Discovering data and data-pipeline:</strong>

    {' '}
    Working as a digital marketing specialist, I had a lot of reporting to do, especially because I was in charge of multiple clients. To make this reporting easier, I Learned
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Python </strong>
    and used Apache Airflow to build a data pipeline
    <br />
    The first part of the pipeline connects to different APIs (Google Ads/Facebook/Google Analytics/CRM)  to get the data I need for my reporting. The data is then sent to a
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Big Query </strong>
    data warehouse. The second part of the pipeline uses
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Pandas </strong>
    to process the data from different sources to get some useful insights. The result is sent by email.
    <br />
    To make the development of this app easier I used
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Docker </strong>
    so I could
    <strong className="blueTitle"> Docker-compose </strong>
    my app anywhere.
